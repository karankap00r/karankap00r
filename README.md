I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at Grab in the FinID team. As a software engineer, I get to play several roles :

- One of the major parts of my responsibilities right now is developing a system that satisfies business needs and is technically sound at the same time.
- Having design discussions within the team to gauge how can we design our system in a way so that it is efficient, extensible, scalable, and maintainable. This involves having an eye for the future and how what we build today will be used tomorrow.
- I occasionally take part in meetings to communicate business ideas to our team by acting as a middleware between the two, trying to convert a business problem into a technical problem.
- I am also one of the people responsible for managing the stability of the system by taking care of system resilience. This involves ensuring best practices among the team in terms of stability that could otherwise impact our application in unforeseen ways.
- I guide my juniors, especially the new joiners as in how to get onboard to the system.
I occasionally take part in interviews for the hiring of candidates in the organisation.
