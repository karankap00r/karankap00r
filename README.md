# Hey, I'm Karan 👋

**Staff Software Engineer · Infrastructure & Product Engineering**

I build and scale systems that process millions of orders daily at [Zepto](https://www.zeptonow.com/) — one of India's fastest-growing quick-commerce companies. I lead infrastructure platform development while also driving engineering across 4 product verticals spanning finance, procurement, seller experience, and catalog management.

I love designing systems and studying engineering concepts in depth.

## What I Do

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Engineering

I operate at the intersection of **databases**, **distributed systems**, and **developer tooling** — focused on making infrastructure reliable, cost-efficient, and easy to operate at scale across a 70+ service monorepo.

- **Large-Scale Migrations** — Orchestrating zero-downtime MongoDB migrations across Zepto services from Atlas to self-hosted infrastructure
- **Cost Optimization** — Driving infrastructure cost reduction through storage lifecycle strategies, database consolidation, and compute right-sizing
- **Operational Excellence** — Designing validation frameworks and engineering institutional memory systems to prevent production incidents

### 🚀 Product Engineering Leadership

I lead engineering for 4 product verticals that power critical business operations:

- **Finance & Compliance** — Systems handling invoicing, GST compliance, and financial reconciliation at scale
- **FnV Procurement** — Procurement infrastructure for Zepto's fruits & vegetables supply chain
- **Brand Seller Experience** — Tooling and platforms enabling brand sellers to operate on the Zepto marketplace
- **Catalog Management System** — The backbone for managing product catalog data across the platform

## A Few Things I've Built

🔧 **mongodb-v2** — A Go library for zero-downtime MongoDB migrations with cluster-aware connection management, automatic failover, and gradual traffic shifting

📉 **S3 Cost Optimizer** — Lifecycle management strategies that reduced storage costs from $41K/month to under $1K
